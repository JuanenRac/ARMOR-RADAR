All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [0.2.1] - The LD2450 frame decoder

- `main/core/ld2450.hpp` decodes the HLK-LD2450 report frame from the Hi-Link manual V1.00: 30 bytes, header `AA FF 03 00`, three 8-byte targets (x, y, speed, distance resolution, bit 15 set means positive), tail `55 CC`. The manual's worked example is a test and decodes to the manual's values.
- `TrackSet` keeps the newest tracks of the three radars and forgets a radar that stops reporting, so a dead radar leaves no ghost targets.
- The firmware wires the decoder to the framers and publishes telemetry at most five times a second, but **withholds it while there is no ambient-light reading** (no light-sensor driver yet) instead of inventing a lux value. It is not compiled here (no ESP-IDF).
- The slot number (1 to 3) is used as the track id because the manual gives no better identity; an LD2461 is not decoded (no document). 124 host checks (was 77).

## [0.2.0]

- Hardware-independent core with 77 host checks: resynchronising framer, contract-exact JSON, dew point, PTC controller, static-reflector map, node-id validation.
- Firmware refuses invalid identity and duplicate pins, uses SNTP time and an MQTT last will.
- The LD2450/LD2461 frame layout is intentionally not decoded until the vendor document is available.
